seeing Amyra grow in front of you and now acting like a grown up person feels odd. 

She’s no more a little kiddo I can squish or will eat anything I make. She’s a person now. Has her own feelings, own choices and some rather strong one. 

I have to learn to treat her like a person instead of  a child now. Which means, honouring the promises I make to her, intentionally spending time with her like teaching badminton or making hot chocolate because, she’s a child growing into a person now and the rate at which this is happening feels faster than things changing in my life. 

Its no surprise but looking at these siblings, is a realisation that time moves fast and rate of growth is much faster at younger age and i think beyond a threshold you’re not growing, just decaying I guess. 

So, its best to be intentional about how you’re spending your time and with whom more so as you age.
